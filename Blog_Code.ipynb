Data Scientists use this component to select an appropriate algorithm, tune hyperparameters, and train the model on the data. The trained model is then evaluated for its performance, and if it meets the desired level of accuracy, it is deployed for production use. The role of Data Scientists in this component is to select and fine-tune the machine learning models that best fit the problem at hand, and ensure that the models meet the business requirements. Ultimately, the model trainer component helps Data Scientists to generate insights and make predictions that can drive business decisions."
